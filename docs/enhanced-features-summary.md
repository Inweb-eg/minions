## Next Monday Morning

Start with the highest-impact enhancements:

1. **Implement README Amplifier** (Day 1-2)
   - 100x reduction in user input needed
   
2. **Add Cost Router** (Day 3)
   - 95% cost savings immediately
   
3. **Build Predictive Debugger** (Day 4-5)
   - Prevent bugs before they exist

These three alone will transform your system from "automation" to "intelligence"

## Final Thought

> "The original plan builds a system that writes code.
> 
> The enhanced plan builds a system that writes better systems.
> 
> Eventually, it will write a better version of itself.
> 
> This is not automation. This is evolution."

**Welcome to the future of software development.**
